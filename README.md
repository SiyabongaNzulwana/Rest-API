# Rest-API

To run the project just clone the Repo, 
do an `npm install`
`node app` to run it locally
bare in mind you need to have MongoDb running on the backgroung
then using postman you can post a few developers
(e.g) `{
	"name": "Developer Name",
	"position": "Developer position",
	"available": false,
	"geometry": {"type": "point", "coordinates":[-82.589, 26.791]}
}`
